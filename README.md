## Project Background

GreenField Supplies is a wholesaler specialising in buying and selling outdoor products for equestrian, farming, and general outdoor purposes. Over the past year, the company has experienced fluctuating shipping costs, lead times, and stock performance, and in an effort to better understand customer demand and predict future trends, they commissioned a review of overall operational performance.

Recommendations are provided on the following key areas

•  **Inbound Shipments:** An examination of the most recent sales trends and shipment performance.  
•  **Lead Times:** An assessment of supplier performance regarding delivery timelines.  
•  **Stock Levels & Reorder Points:** An analysis of current stock levels and reorder efficiency.  
•  **OTIF (On-Time In-Full):** An evaluation of supplier delivery reliability, with comparisons across the products they provide.  

The Excel file used to inspect clean and analyse the data is [here](Excel/Issue_log.png). 

SQL queries used to export necessary tables you can find [here](SQL/SQL_Queries.sql).

## Executive Summary  

#### Overview of Findings 

**GreenField Supplies** experienced uneven operational performance over the past year. AsiaPlast accounted for 20% of shipping   costs with a March 2025 spike, European lead times averaged 27 days, and Feed Buckets/Tubs saw 17.5% of orders below reorder points, with AsiaPlast   performing worst at 18.3%. UK Tools’ OTIF averaged just under 72%, dipping sharply in May 2025. These findings highlight cost, supply, and   reliability risks that warrant targeted sourcing and process improvements.
